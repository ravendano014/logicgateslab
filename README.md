## Overview 

The Digital Logic Circuit Simulator is a web-based interactive editor and simulator for digital logic circuits. This tool allows users to create, visualize, and simulate various digital logic circuits by dragging and dropping logic gate shapes onto a canvas, connecting them with wires, and observing their behavior.

## Features

- **Canvas Editor:** Design and create digital logic circuits using a user-friendly canvas editor.
- **Logic Gate Shapes:** Choose from a variety of logic gate shapes, including AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, InputL, OutputL, AND3, and OR3 gates.
- **Connectors:** Connect input and output terminals of logic gates with connectors to simulate signal flow.
- **Interactive Interface:** Drag and drop shapes, move them, and create connections easily.
- **Logic Simulation:** Simulate the behavior of logic gates with dynamic updates of gate outputs.
- **Clock Shape:** Add a clock shape and control its state to observe periodic signals.
- **Save and Load:** Save your logic circuits as JSON files and load them for later use.
- **Deletion:** Remove shapes and connectors from the canvas.
- **Customizable UI:** User-friendly interface with responsive canvas and sidebar.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for file operations.

## Usage

1. **Add Shapes:** Drag and drop logic gate shapes from the sidebar onto the canvas.
2. **Connect Shapes:** Create connections between input and output terminals of logic gates.
3. **Simulate:** Double-click on a shape to toggle input colors or evaluate gate outputs.
4. **Clock Control:** Add a clock shape and start/stop it to observe periodic signals.
5. **Save and Load:** Save your circuits as JSON files and load them for future editing.

## Installation

This web-based simulator does not require installation. Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in a web browser.
